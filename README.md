## Getting Started with Create React App

This project is my first venture into building a web application using ReactJS, focused on tracking and analyzing IP addresses. The goal is to create a responsive interface where users can input an IP address and receive detailed information, such as location, ISP details, and potential security threats, by integrating multiple free APIs. The application will feature real-time data rendering, user-friendly error handling, and a mobile-first design. Through this project, I aim to enhance my skills in ReactJS development, API integration, UI/UX design, and deployment, ultimately resulting in a functional and accessible IP tracking tool.
